Suitable methodology application during data pre-processing will be described in \Cref{data_prep}. The selection for appropriate, domain knowledge based, feature selection will be explained in \Cref{feature_select}. The selection of the most optimal model hyperparameter for different tree-based model will be explained in \Cref{hpo}. To validate the model's generalisation capability, statistical performance measure is used. The underlying principle is elaborated in \Cref{model_validation}.

\subsection{Data Acquisition}\label{data_acquisition}

For the purpose of model training, 2021 AIS data from Ro-Ro ferry ship Hammershus is collected. The shore-based AIS data is made available by Danish Maritime Authority which tracked her journey between ports of K{\o}ge, R{\o}nne, Ystad and Sassnitz and structured according to \Cref{AIS_struct}. The AIS data is fused with weather data from ECMWF\footnote{European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast} with temporal resolution of 1 hour at granularity of 0.25° (longitude) x 0.25° (latitude), data from ECMWF provides information for wind, waves and seawater temperature. The information for current is obtained from CMEMS\footnote{Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service} with temporal resolution of 3 hours at granularity of  0.25° (longitude) x 0.25° (latitude).\\ 

The resulting fusion resulted in dataset with temporal resolution of 1 hour. Some information static information from the AIS data which only indicated the ship's identity are excluded. This includes ship's MMSI, Callsign, Name, IMO and Navigational Status. Additionally, information of the ship's Rate of Turn (ROT) is not available in this case. The weather information is synchronised so that the wind, waves, seawater temperature and sea current belongs to the same weather grid with same temporal resolutions.\\ 

Through vector decomposition, information of Northward and Eastward wind velocity is converted to absolute wind speed and wind direction \emph{with respect to True North},$\varphi$:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:vwindabs}
    V_{\text{wind}} = \sqrt{(V_{\text{wind}}^N)^2 + (V_{\text{wind}}^E)^2} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:winddir}
    \varphi = 
    \begin{cases}
        360 - \arctan(\frac{V_{\text{wind}}^E}{V_{\text{wind}}^N}) \quad \text{\textbf{if}} \quad V_{\text{wind}}^E > 0 \quad \wedge \quad V_{\text{wind}}^N < 0 \\ 
        180 - \arctan(\frac{V_{\text{wind}}^E}{V_{\text{wind}}^N}) \quad \text{\textbf{if}} \quad V_{\text{wind}}^E < 0 \quad \wedge \quad V_{\text{wind}}^N > 0 \\ 
        270 - \arctan(\frac{V_{\text{wind}}^E}{V_{\text{wind}}^N}) \quad \text{\textbf{if}} \quad V_{\text{wind}}^E > 0 \quad \wedge \quad V_{\text{wind}}^N > 0 \\
        \arctan(\frac{V_{\text{wind}}^E}{V_{\text{wind}}^N}) \qquad \text{\textbf{otherwise}} 
    \end{cases}   
\end{equation}

Similarly, information of Northward and Eastward current Velocity is converted to absolute current speed and current direction \emph{with respect to True North} $\gamma$.\\ 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:vcurrabs}
    V_{\text{current}} = \sqrt{(V_{\text{current}}^N)^2 + (V_{\text{current}}^E)^2} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:currdir}
    \gamma = 
    \begin{cases}
        360 - \arctan(\frac{V_{\text{current}}^E}{V_{\text{current}}^N}) \quad \text{\textbf{if}} \quad V_{\text{current}}^E < 0 \quad \wedge \quad V_{\text{current}}^N > 0 \\ 
        180 - \arctan(\frac{V_{\text{current}}^E}{V_{\text{current}}^N}) \quad \text{\textbf{if}} \quad V_{\text{current}}^E > 0 \quad \wedge \quad V_{\text{current}}^N < 0 \\ 
        270 - \arctan(\frac{V_{\text{current}}^E}{V_{\text{current}}^N}) \quad \text{\textbf{if}} \quad V_{\text{current}}^E < 0 \quad \wedge \quad V_{\text{current}}^N < 0 \\
        \arctan(\frac{V_{\text{current}}^E}{V_{\text{current}}^N}) \qquad \text{\textbf{otherwise}} 
    \end{cases}   
\end{equation}

Additional information is then added to the dataset. True direction information is added to gain information of the effect of weather direction \emph{with respect to ship's beam}. As such, from information based on True North such as: wind direction, current direction, swell direction, wind wave direction and true wave direction, are converted to information on true direction and added to the dataset. The initial structure have 32 features, 9 AIS feature and 23 weather features. The structure of the initial dataset i.e. before data preprocessing and feature selection, is summarised in \Cref{dataset_init_struct} \\

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}\label{data_prep}

This section presents the steps taken to during data preprocessing. The dataset will be first subjected to data cleaning which include identification of anomalies and missing values, the steps are explained in \Cref{data_cleaning}. Boundary condition is then applied to ensure that the model represent operating condition at steady state. Using domain knowledge, appropriate features are selected and discarded to ensure the model obeys shipping domain knowledge. This dataset is to be split into training, validation and test dataset. These steps will be further elaborated in \Cref{feature_select}.

\subsubsection{Data Cleaning}\label{data_cleaning}

The journey between the port of K{\o}ge, R{\o}nne, Ystad and Sassnitz is plotted using {\tt QGIS}\footnote{https://qgis.org/en/site/, {\tt QGIS} is a free and open source geographic information system}. The plot of the journey is shown in \Cref{fig:YearJourney}, it can be seen, that the journey between R{\o}nne and Sassnitz is not represented completely. As in this information is missing due to poor coverage in the area between Sassnitz and R{\o}nne. This is shown by the plot shown in \Cref{fig:aiscoverage}. Therefore, the data plot for the journey between Sassnitz and R{\o}nne will be excluded. Basic threshold of decimal degrees of 55.04° N for latitude is applied, this threshold will exclude the journey between Sassnitz and R{\o}nne.\\ 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{02_figures/SassnitznoFilter.png}
        \caption{Journey of the ship in a year}
        \label{fig:YearJourney}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{02_figures/AIS_Coverage.png}
        \caption{Shore based AIS Coverage based on data from AIS database \cite{webaisdk.2023}}
        \label{fig:aiscoverage}
\end{figure}

In its initial state, the dataset contains 7453 data points which described the journey of the ship in one year. To gain better insight, the data points are visualised in figure $\dots$. The initial dataset considers all navigational status of the ship, which include ``mooring'', ``anchoring'' and ``underway using engine''. This is clearly observed in the histogram for the SOG distribution in fifure \dots, with large data count when the ship is stationary. To ensure that the dataset represents the actual operating condition of ship in steady state, a threshold of 5 knots is applied. SOG can vary due to changing sea state, but it can also be reduced by the ship's operator around the port when it departs from port of origin or arriving at port of origin. Any data points with SOG less than 5 knots will be discarded which is considered as manoeuvring \cite{Abebe.2020}.\\

Source of error can also be observed in data points of current speed. In current speed range around $0.01 - 0.03$ \verb|m/s|, there is unreasonable amount of data points within this range. This error is attributed to missing information on northward and eastward current speed in some data points from the provided dataset. This resulted in misrepresented absolute current speed within this data points. To address the missing values, the missing data points are imputed using {\tt KNNImputer} feature from {\tt Scikit-Learn}. Each sample's missing values are imputed using the mean of nearest neighbour found in training dataset \cite{FabianPedregosa.2011}. Once the missing values of northward and southward current are imputed, resulting current speed can be calculated and as shown by figure $\dots$, anomalies are corrected. The imputing approach using k-nearest neighbour is also applied to data points that contain {\tt NaN} values, as the model provided by {\tt Scikit-Learn} cannot handle missing values.\\

\subsubsection{Feature Selection}\label{feature_select}

To select appropriate features for the model, correlation between the features is first studied. Selection of features is based on statistical approach of High Correlation Filter proposed by Abebe et al. \cite{Abebe.2020}. This approach considers pairs of features with correlation features higher than 0.7 as one entity. However, the selection of highly correlated features must not violate natural state of matter. Therefore, in addition to statistical approach, the scienctific reasoning behind the correlations will be considered and prioritised over the statistical approach.\\

The features combined wind wave swell height, swell height, maximum wave height and wind wave height are physically correlated. In sea wave theory, wind wave swell height is also known as significant wave height $H_{1/3}$. It is defined as the mean of the highest one-third of waves in the wave record \cite{Holthuijsen.2007}. \\

\begin{figure}
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.85\textwidth]{02_figures/Bretschneider_1965_wavedist.jpg}
        \caption{Statistical distribution of wave heights \cite{bretschneider.1965}}
        \label{fig:wavestats}
\end{figure}

The distribution of wave heights can be represented by probability density function. Hence, the term ``highest one-third of waves'' here means the region of wave heights that belong in the upper one-third of a probability density function, this is illustrated in \Cref{fig:wavestats}. From this distribution, the relation between significant wave height $H_{1/3}$, the highest ten percent of waves $H_{10}$ and average wave height $\overline{H}$ can be summarised as follows \cite{bretschneider.1965,Holthuijsen.2007}: 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Hsig_mean}
    \overline{H} = 0.625\cdot H_{1/3}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Hsig_Hten}
    H_{10} = 2.03\cdot \overline{H} = 1.27\cdot H_{1/3} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Hsig_max}
    H_{\text{max}} = 2 \cdot H_{1/3} 
\end{equation} 

Additionally, Bitner-Gregersen \cite{BitnerGregersen.2005} described the relation between the significant wave height, wind wave height and swell height through following equation:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:H_sig_root}
    H_{1/3} = \sqrt{(H_{\text{swell}})^2 + (H_{\text{windwave}})^2} 
\end{equation}

From here, it is clear that significant wave height should be retained for modelling, as it holds critical information regarding wave properties. The features swell height, wind wave height and maximum wave height will be dropped as it can be defined through correlations defined in \Cref{eqn:Hsig_mean},\Cref{eqn:Hsig_Hten},\Cref{eqn:Hsig_max} and \Cref{eqn:H_sig_root}. This decision is also statistically supported through the high correlation filter method. As shown in \Cref{fig:heatmap1}, high correlation are observed between these features.\\

    \caption{Correlation Heat Map}
    \label{fig:heatmap_ovr}
\end{figure}

From the \Cref{fig:heatmap1}, high correlation is observed between wave direction, swell direction and wind wave direction. Bitner-Gregersen further elaborated that the state of the sea can be described through so called   \cite{K.Torsethaugen.2004}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Methodology Application}\label{methodology_application}



\begin{itemize}
    \item Two data sources are imported. {\tt AIS\_weather\_H\_ok2\_copy.csv} \\ and {\tt AIS\_weather\_h\_rename\_copy.csv}. The information from the latter comma delimited 
    file will be used for calculating the ship Speed Through Water (STW).  
    The information required is the true north current direction. Which is obtained from the vector component of the Northward and Southward current.
    \item This dataframe will be merged with the main dataframe from \\ the file {\tt AIS\_weather\_H\_ok2\_copy.csv}.
    \item Omission of the journey data between Ronne and Sassnitz
    \item SOG threshold is applied to omit ship mooring and maneuvering to accurately represent the ship's steady state operation 
    \cite{Abebe.2020,BalBesikci.2016,Gkerekos.2019,Yang.2020}. This threshold is selected as 5 knots according to \cite{Abebe.2020}
    \item The AIS data from June is filtered. This data will be used as validation data to check the model's performance.
\end{itemize}
 
\subsection{Data Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The features are represented in a histogram plot. For the feature Current speed, anomaly is detected. Certain spike is detected around $0.01 - 0.03$ \verb|m/s|. Reasons unknown. The data is retained, including the spike, until a definitive answer can be found.
    \item OPEN QUESTION : What is the necessity of feature standardization / normalization ? Normalization is required for ANN as model training requires the value between 0 and 1. But in case of RFR, there is no such requirement. Through testing, data standardization also does not seem to improve the model's performance.

\end{sidewaysfigure}

\newpage

\begin{itemize}
    \item The correlation of the features against SOG are determined. It is found that :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Draught
        \item Course Over Ground (COG)
        \item heading
        \item Wind Speed
        \item Current Speed
        \item True Current direction
    \end{itemize}
    Have relatively stronger correlation to SOG compared to other features, albeit the correlation is a weak one
    \item The correlation between the features is displayed using the following the heat map. From the heat map it can be observed that between these features:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Waveheight and wind wave swell height
        \item Waveheight and wind wave height
        \item Windwaveswellheight and wave period
    \end{itemize}
    Have a strong correlation between each other.  
    \item Open topic: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Feature reduction is possible, \cite{Abebe.2020} suggested high feature correlation filter, the filter suggest that two features which has a high correlation $(>90\%)$ is to be combined into a single feature. But the author is unsure whether this combination is physically sensible. Hence, this filter is yet to be applied for feature reduction. 
        \item Some of these features can be connected through wave equations, but the author has not found an equation which could relate these features.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The random forest regressor could not function when \verb|NaN| values are present. With that, the missing values are filled in using the {\tt imputer} function. The missing values are filled in by means of \verb|KNN|.

\subsection{Modelling}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The data is split into 80:20 ratio. But considering the validation data, it is split into approximately 73:18:9.
    \item The model is then trained using Random Forest Regression (RFR). Additional training is also performed using Decision Tree Regressor (DTR). DTR model performance will be used as a benchmark as it is also a tree-based modelling method with similar methodology to RFR.
    \item The computational time of DTR is significantly faster than RFR
    Model Evaluation    
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Predicting STW}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The ship's Speed Through Water STW can be calculated using vector component of the SOG and current speed. The direction used will be according to True North. \cite{Yang.2020,Zhou.2020}
    \item SOG represents the speed of the ship with reference to the ground, while the STW represent the ship's speed with reference to water.
    \item SOG also can be termed by the ship's speed that is captured by the GPS, and does not consider any effect of the current
    \item This means that the ship's STW will be greater than the ship's SOG when there is current moving against the ship's movement direction and vice versa 
    \item The vector decomposition can be defined from the following equations, which is based on the equation by \cite{Yang.2020}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The ship's SOG $V_g$ can be decomposed into $V_{g}^x$ and $V_{g}^y$, which represents the $x$ and $y$ components of the SOG respectively using the ship's course heading (COG) $\beta$ \emph{with respect to True North}:
        \begin{equation}\label{eqvgx}
            V_{g}^x = V_g\sin(\beta)   
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}\label{eqvgy}
            V_{g}^y = V_g\cos(\beta)   
        \end{equation}
        \item To consider the effect of sea current. The current speed $V_c$ will also be decomposed to $x$ and $y$ components respectively using the current direction $\gamma$ \emph{with respect to True North}:
        \begin{equation}\label{eqvcx}
            V_{c}^x = V_g\sin(\gamma)   
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}\label{eqvcy}
            V_{c}^y = V_g\cos(\gamma)   
        \end{equation}
        \item from here the ship' STW $V_{wx}$ and $V_{wy}$ component can be found from the following equation: 
        \begin{equation}
            V_{w}^x = V_{g}^x - V_{c}^x    
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}
            V_{w}^y = V_{g}^y - V_{c}^y 
        \end{equation}
        \item The magnitude of the STW can be readily obtained from the following vector synthesis
        \begin{equation}
            V_w = \sqrt{(V_{w}^x)^2 + (V_{w}^y)^2} 
        \end{equation}
    \end{itemize}
    \newpage

    \item This principle is applied to the following Python script. \ref{eqvcx}
