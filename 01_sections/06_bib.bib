@article{Basturk.2023,
 abstract = {The impact of fuel consumption on merchant ships is categorized in both economic and environmental ways in terms of sustainable blue growth. Apart from the economic benefits of reducing fuel consumption, attention should be paid to related environmental concerns with ship fuels. As a result of global regulations and agreements concerning mitigating greenhouse gases on board, such as the International Maritime Organization and Paris Agreement, ships have to take a step to reduce fuel consumption to adopt these regulations. The present study aims to determine optimal speed diversity depending on ships' cargo amounts and wind-sea states to reduce fuel consumption. Within this context, one-year voyage data from two model sister Ro--Ro cargo ships were used, including daily ship speed, daily fuel consumption, ballast water consumption, total ship cargo consumption, sea state, and wind state. The genetic algorithm method was used to determine the optimal diversity rate. In conclusion, after speed optimization, optimum speed result values are calculated between 16.59 and 17.29 knots; thus, approximately 18{\%} of exhaust gas emissions were also reduced.},

@article{Breiman.1996,
 abstract = {Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.},

@article{Breiman.2001,
 abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

@article{Coraddu.2017,
 abstract = {In this paper the authors investigate the problems of predicting the fuel consumption and of providing the best value for the trim of a vessel in real operations based on data measured by the onboard automation systems. Three different approaches for the prediction of the fuel consumption are compared: White, Black and Gray Box Models. White Box Models (WBM) are based on the knowledge of the physical underling processes. Black Box Models (BBMs) build upon statistical inference procedures based on the historical data collection. Finally, the authors propose two different Gray Box Model (GBM) which are able to exploit both mechanistic knowledge of the underlying physical principles and available measurements. Based on these predictive models of the fuel consumption a new strategy for the optimisation of the trim of a vessel is proposed. Results on real world operational data show that the BBM is able to remarkably improve a state-of-the-art WBM, while the GBM is able to encapsulate the a-priory knowledge of the WBM into the BBM so to achieve the same performance of the latter but requiring less historical data. Moreover, results show that the GBM can be used as an effective tool for optimising the trim of a vessel in real operational conditions.},

@phdthesis{Eide.2015,
 abstract = {In this thesis two tankers owned by Kristian Gerhard Jebsen Skipsrederi (KGJS) were investigated. A method of calculating service and sea margins for different speeds has been developed. When a ship is in normal operation, the additional power required to reach a certain speed will be higher than the predicted and measured on the delivery sea trial. This increase due to wind, waves and fouling is usually expressed as a sea margin. Typical values are 15-20\% of the power required in ideal conditions.The model in this thesis used noon reports provided by KGJS for the two ships. These are daily reports of fuel consumption, speed and weather conditions. For each report the added power due to waves, wind and roughness were calculated. The change in propeller efficiency due to the added resistance was calculated and the calm water power requirement was corrected for changes in draft. The calm water speed-power relation for the ships did not cover the whole speed range typical for the ships. Therefore the relation was extrapolated to also cover the lower speeds.The results indicate that the total sea margin and the wave part of the margin both decrease with speed. The wind part of the sea margin seems to be negligible on average. The fouling part of the margin was modeled as roughness according to theory. This results in a constant fouling margin independent of speed of 15-20\%. This was an underestimation for the lower speeds, which could indicate that the calm water speed-power relationship was underestimated for the lower speeds where model test data was not available and the relationship was estimated.Approximate formulas were developed for calculating the different margins. The total sea margin and the wave margin are inversely proportional to the ship speed. The wind margin seems to be negligible.},

@misc{Faber.2012,
 abstract = {This report studies the legal and technical constraints to possible mandatory speed regulation for ships. It also analyses the design of these regulations and the costs and benefits. The report shows that slow steaming has significant environmental benefits, and, in most scenarios, economic benefits as well. Regulated slow steaming is legally feasible and feasible to implement. Regulated slow steaming has a number of advantages: it is the most cost effective way to reduce ship emissions, and if implemented correctly, it is cost free to the shipping industry as a whole and entails marginal incremental logistic and supply chain costs to consumers; regulated slow steaming ensures that emissions in the shipping sector will be reduced, regardless of the fuel price and demand for shipping; a cap on speed would reduce the risk of an otherwise likely spike in emissions if ships were to speed up in response to a recovery in demand; a cap set today around current average ship speeds will have little impact on industry in the short term; and regulated slow steaming is relatively easy to monitor and enforce, and may have a lower administrative burden than some of the recently proposed market-based measures. There are also disadvantages to regulated slow steaming: A restriction on speed reduces market flexibility; because of the perceived loss of market flexibility, regulated slow steaming appears to be widely opposed by shipping companies and shippers; it may not be cost-effective for all ships, on all routes or for all ship types; it reduces the cost-effectiveness of other means of fuel efficiency improvements and may result in less innovation; since it prescribes a specific measure it would run contrary to the goal-based approach to shipping environmental policy favoured in recent years; and while regulated slow steaming, if implemented carefully, need not impose additional costs on the shipping sector as a whole, neither would it raise revenues for use in fighting climate change in developing countries.},

@article{Farag.2020,
 abstract = {Maximizing the ship operational energy efficiency requires robust tools to monitor, estimate, and predict the ship's performance under dynamic sea environments. Knowledge of ships' fuel consumption using an appropriate prediction algorithm prior to (or during) a voyage can be a very important tool in reducing GHG emissions from international shipping. Classical methods for power estimation are approximate procedures that lack the required sensitivity to track sea environmental effects on ship performance. Meanwhile, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as a computing system has proven its applicability in estimating its systems outputs. It also has the ability to capture, learn and adapt to the changes that may occur within the system's variables.

The proposed model has employed combined ANN and Multi-Regression (MR) techniques to estimate the ship's power and fuel consumption. The proposed model has the ability to function in a real-time environment and adapt to changes that may occur to the ship environment. Additionally, the proposed model has been developed by processing intensive datasets rather than traditional Noon Reports that have been relied on in many previous studies.

Finally, the developed model was utilized to predict potential fuel saving in a Just-In-Time (JIT) scenario for one of the ship's voyages.},

It essentially consists of randomizing strongly both attribute and cut-point choice while splitting a tree node. In the extreme case, it builds totally randomized trees whose structures are independent of the output values of the learning sample. The strength of the randomization can be tuned to problem specifics by the appropriate choice of a parameter. We evaluate the robustness of the default choice of this parameter, and we also provide insight on how to adjust it in particular situations. Besides accuracy, the main strength of the resulting algorithm is computational efficiency. A bias/variance analysis of the Extra-Trees algorithm is also provided as well as a geometrical and a kernel characterization of the models induced.},

 abstract = {We present a novel convex optimisation model for ship speed profile optimisation under varying environmental conditions, with a fixed schedule for the journey. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, a combined speed profile optimisation model was developed that employed an existing dynamic programming approach, along the novel convex optimisation model. The proposed model was tested with 5 different ships for 20 journeys from Houston, Texas to London Gateway, with differing environmental conditions, which were retrieved from actual weather forecasts. As a result, it was shown that the combined model with both dynamic programming and convex optimisation was approximately 22{\%} more effective in developing a fuel saving speed profile compared to dynamic programming alone. Overall, average fuel savings for the studied voyages with speed profile optimisation was approximately 1.1{\%} compared to operation with a fixed speed and 3.5{\%} for voyages where significant variance in environmental conditions was present. Speed profile optimisation was found to be especially beneficial in cases where detrimental environmental conditions could be avoided with minor speed adjustments. Relaxation of the fixed schedule constraint likely leads to larger savings but makes comparison virtually impossible as a lower speed leads to lower propulsion energy needed.},

Moreover, all the parameters can be accessed separately in the form of wind waves and swells. The historical results show that the simulated wave characteristics agree well with satellite observations and the ERA5 reanalysis products.

@article{Li.2017,
 abstract = {The Shipboard Automatic Identification System (AIS) is crucial for navigation safety and maritime surveillance, data mining and pattern analysis of AIS information have attracted considerable attention in terms of both basic research and practical applications. Clustering of spatio-temporal AIS trajectories can be used to identify abnormal patterns and mine customary route data for transportation safety. Thus, the capacities of navigation safety and maritime traffic monitoring could be enhanced correspondingly. However, trajectory clustering is often sensitive to undesirable outliers and is essentially more complex compared with traditional point clustering. To overcome this limitation, a multi-step trajectory clustering method is proposed in this paper for robust AIS trajectory clustering. In particular, the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a similarity measurement method, is introduced in the first step to measure the distances between different trajectories. The calculated distances, inversely proportional to the similarities, constitute a distance matrix in the second step. Furthermore, as a widely-used dimensional reduction method, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is exploited to decompose the obtained distance matrix. In particular, the top k principal components with above 95{\%} accumulative contribution rate are extracted by PCA, and the number of the centers k is chosen. The k centers are found by the improved center automatically selection algorithm. In the last step, the improved center clustering algorithm with k clusters is implemented on the distance matrix to achieve the final AIS trajectory clustering results. In order to improve the accuracy of the proposed multi-step clustering algorithm, an automatic algorithm for choosing the k clusters is developed according to the similarity distance. Numerous experiments on realistic AIS trajectory datasets in the bridge area waterway and Mississippi River have been implemented to compare our proposed method with traditional spectral clustering and fast affinity propagation clustering. Experimental results have illustrated its superior performance in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluations.},

In ship speed optimization, considering the influence of weather conditions, route segmentation and weather data loading methods significantly affect the reliability of speed optimization results. Therefore, taking the ocean-going container ship as the research object, on the basis of constructing the main engine fuel consumption prediction model and shaft speed prediction model based on machine learning methods, a route segmentation and weather loading-speed optimization iterative algorithm is proposed in this study. Single-objective speed optimization research is then conducted based on the algorithm. The research results show that the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the difference between optimized fuel consumption and actual fuel consumption, and can achieve a fuel-saving rate between 2.1{\%} and 5.2{\%}. This study achieves an accurate and reliable prediction of ship fuel consumption and shaft speed, and solves the strong coupling problem between route segmentation, weather loading, and speed optimization by iterative optimization of ship speed. The proposed algorithm provides strong technical support for ships to achieve the goal of energy saving and emission reduction.},

This is done to avoid use of commercial ship databases, which can be expensive for research on sizable fleets. Using the approximation method Holtrop-Mennen it is possible to find a distinct ships propulsion power requirements for different speeds. This empirical method uses main ship characteristics for calculation. From AIS data several main ship characteristics can be derived. Remaining characteristics is found by generic ship approximation found in literature surveys. This is used in combination with power prediction and specific fuel consumption, and applied to different ship size categories, as fuel consumption is calculated from speeds in dynamic AIS data. Fuel consumption and CO2 emission are derived and compared to earlier studies.},

@article{Taskar.2020,
 abstract = {Currently, the shipping industry is facing a great challenge of reducing emissions. Reducing ship speeds will reduce the emissions in the immediate future with no additional infrastructure. However, a detailed investigation is required to verify the claim that a 10{\%} speed reduction would lead to 19{\%} fuel savings (Faber et al., 2012).

This paper investigates fuel savings due to speed reduction using detailed modeling of ship performance. Three container ships, two bulk carriers, and one tanker, representative of the shipping fleet, have been designed. Voyages have been simulated by modeling calm water resistance, wave resistance, propulsion efficiency, and engine limits. Six ships have been simulated in various weather conditions at different speeds. Potential fuel savings have been estimated for a range of speed reductions in realistic weather.

It is concluded that the common assumption of cubic speed-power relation can cause a significant error in the estimation of bunker consumption. Simulations in different seasons have revealed that fuel savings due to speed reduction are highly weather dependent. Therefore, a simple way to include the effect of weather in shipping transport models has been proposed.

Speed reduction can lead to an increase in the number of ships to fulfill the transport demand. Therefore, the emission reduction potential of speed reduction strategy, after accounting for the additional ships, has been studied. Surprisingly, when the speed is reduced by 30{\%}, fuel savings vary from 2{\%} to 45{\%} depending on ship type, size and weather conditions. Fuel savings further reduce when the auxiliary engines are considered.},

 abstract = {Decision trees are attractive classifiers due to their high execution speed. But trees derived with traditional methods often cannot be grown to arbitrary complexity for possible loss of generalization accuracy on unseen data. The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved. The validity of the method is demonstrated through experiments on the recognition of handwritten digits.},

@article{Tzortzis.2021,
 abstract = {The determination of the appropriate operational profile of a ship through the adjustment of its sailing speed can potentially present a fruitful prospect in the effort towards the maximization of energy resources exploitation in commercial ships. The dependency of fuel consumption on speed, always in inseparable conjunction with the ever-changing weather conditions prevailing over any specified route, leads to the formulation of a (from mathematical point of view) not well-defined problem, when practical considerations regarding the capabilities of currently available weather forecast services are taken into account. In the present work, a method for the dynamic determination of optimal ship speed, in a fixed route, is proposed. Within this method, the problem of deteriorating accuracy of weather predictions for relatively long time periods is addressed with the segmentation of the route's total time horizon in smaller time periods, in order for solvable and meaningful optimization problems to be formulated. The interdependency between the individual sub-problems is established and examined with the definition of appropriate method parameters, which are representative of the most important time scales of the engineering problem at hand. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated with the application on an actual container ship route.},

It proceeds to investigate the optimal sailing speed of container ships on each leg of each ship route in a liner shipping network while considering transshipment and container routing. This problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model. In view of the convexity, non-negativity, and univariate properties of the bunker consumption function, an efficient outer-approximation method is proposed to obtain an \textgreek{e}-optimal solution with a predetermined optimality tolerance level \textgreek{e}. The proposed model and algorithm is applied to a real case study for a global liner shipping company.},

@article{Wang.2018,
 abstract = {During the voyage, predicting fuel consumption of ships under different sea-states and weather conditions has been a challenging and far-reaching topic, because there are a great number of feature variables affecting the fuel consumption, including main-engine status, cargo weight, ship draft, sea-states and weather conditions, etc. Data driven statistical models have been employed to model the relationship between fuel consumption rate and these voyage parameters. However, some of the feature variables are highly correlated, e.g. wind speed and wave height, air pressure and wind force, cargo weight and draft etc., thus a typical multiple collinearity problem arises so that the fuel consumption cannot be accurately calculated by using the traditional multiple linear regression. In this study, the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression algorithm is employed to implement the variable selection for these feature variables, additionally, it guides the trained predictor towards a generalizable solution, thereby improving the interpretability and accuracy of the model. On the basis of the LASSO, a novel ship fuel consumption prediction model is proposed. Experimentally, the superiority of the proposed method was confirmed by comparing it with some existing methods on predicting the fuel consumption. The proposed method is a promising development that improves the calculation of the fuel consumption.},

@article{Yang.2021,
 abstract = {Resistance is one of the important performance indicators of ships. In this paper, a prediction method based on the Radial Basis Function neural network (RBFNN) is proposed to predict the resistance of a 13500 transmission extension unit (13500TEU) container ship at different drafts. The predicted draft state in the known range is called interpolation prediction; otherwise, it is extrapolation prediction. First, ship features are extracted to make the resistance Rt prediction. The resistance prediction results show that the performance of the RBFNN is significantly better than the other four machine learning models, backpropagation neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Then, the ship data is processed in a dimensionless manner, and the models mentioned above are used to predict the total resistance coefficient Ct of the container ship. The prediction results show that the RBFNN prediction model still performs well. Good results can be obtained by RBFNN in interpolation prediction, even when using part of dimensionless features. Finally, the accuracy of the prediction method based on RBFNN is greatly improved compared with the modified admiralty coefficient.},

 abstract = {Random forest (RF) methodology is one of the most popular machine learning techniques for prediction problems. In this article, we discuss some cases where random forests may suffer and propose a novel generalized RF method, namely regression-enhanced random forests (RERFs), that can improve on RFs by borrowing the strength of penalized parametric regression. The algorithm for constructing RERFs and selecting its tuning parameters is described. Both simulation study and real data examples show that RERFs have better predictive performance than RFs in important situations often encountered in practice. Moreover, RERFs may incorporate known relationships between the response and the predictors, and may give reliable predictions in extrapolation problems where predictions are required at points out of the domain of the training dataset. Strategies analogous to those described here can be used to improve other machine learning methods via combination with penalized parametric regression techniques.},

Thus, big data analysis for smart ships is an important technology that can be widely applied to improve ship maintenance, operational efficiency, and equipment life management. In this study, an accurate regression model for the fuel consumption of the main engine by using an artificial neural network (ANN) was proposed by big data analysis including data collection, clustering, compression, and expansion. To obtain an accurate regression model, various numbers of hidden layers and neurons and different types of activation functions were tested in the ANN, and their effects on the accuracy and efficiency of the regression analysis were studied. The proposed regression model using ANN is a more accurate and efficient model to predict the fuel consumption of the main engine than polynomial regression and support vector machine.},

@article{Ronen.2011,
 abstract = {AbstractThe changing prices of bunker fuel open the door for substantial cost savings by adjusting the sailing speed of ships. A large ship may be burning up to 100 000 USD of bunker fuel per day, which may constitute more than 75{\%} of its operating costs. Reducing the cruising speed by 20{\%} reduces daily bunker consumption by 50{\%}. However, in order to maintain liner service frequency and capacity, reducing the cruising speed may require additional ships to operate a route. We construct a cost model that we use to analyse the trade-off between speed reduction and adding vessels to a container line route, and devise a simple procedure to identify the sailing speed and number of vessels that minimize the annual operating cost of the route. Using published data, we demonstrate the potential for large-cost savings when one operates close to the minimal-cost speed. The presented methodology and procedure are applicable for any bunker fuel price.},

One year earlier, Niko Wijnolst had published Design Innovation in Shipping, based on work at the Delft University of Technology. The two books together offered a comprehensive insight and overview into the dynamics of global shipping and maritime innovation. Although the core of the books held its value, it was decided to make an update of the two books and merge them into one new textbook, Shipping Innovation, destined for a broad specter of maritime students and professionals. Some substantial new parts were added, as well as some new contributions by other writers. This textbook offers a one-stop-shopping experience to those students and professionals who wish to get acquainted with the multifaceted aspects of global shipping and its everlasting innovation dynamics. Some of the new contributions are the mission-based design process of a Panamax containership and a ro-ro vessel; sustainable shipping and innovation; and an innovation case-study on the revolutionary design of a ballast-free ship.},

 abstract = {Monitoring of operational efficiency in ship fleets is a complex maritime problem which requires an analytical approach in order to provide satisfactory solutions. Since the problem involves high-dimensional data, this paper develops tree-based modelling on bagging, random forest and bootstrap approach to analyse the ship performance under operational condition. To demonstrate the proposed model, the publicly accessible dataset for 254 trips derived from a particular designed acquisition system on-board ferry ship is utilised. In operational variable analysis on speed through water and fuel consumption, the bootstrap approach yields more accurate prediction rate than random forest and bagging. The proposed model is superior to the others such as ANN and GP applications in ship performance monitoring. Consequently, the tree based model adopting bagging, random forest, and boosting environment is capable of increasing the predictive performance during monitoring of ship performance in maritime industry. Beside its theoretical insight, the findings of the paper contribute ship management companies to monitor ship operational performance.},
