 abstract = {The shipping industry is associated with approximately three quarters of all world trade. In recent years, the sustainability of shipping has become a public concern, and various emissions control regulations to reduce pollutants and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships have been proposed and implemented globally. These regulations aim to drive the shipping industry in a low-carbon and low-pollutant direction by motivating it to switch to more efficient fuel types and reduce energy consumption. At the same time, the cyclical downturn of the world economy and high bunker prices make it necessary and urgent for the shipping industry to operate in a more cost-effective way while still satisfying global trade demand. As bunker fuel bunker (e.g., heavy fuel oil [HFO], liquified natural gas [LNG]) consumption is the main source of emissions and bunker fuel costs account for a large proportion of operating costs, shipping companies are making unprecedented efforts to optimize ship energy efficiency. It is widely accepted that the key to improving the energy efficiency of ships is the development of accurate models to predict ship fuel consumption rates under different scenarios. In this study, ship fuel consumption prediction models presented in the literature (including the academic literature and technical reports as a typical type of ``grey literature'') are reviewed and compared, and models that optimize ship operations based on fuel consumption prediction results are also presented and discussed. Current research challenges and promising research questions on ship performance monitoring and operational optimization are identified.},

@article{Kim.2020b,
 abstract = {To prevent pollution from ships, the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) is a mandatory guideline for all new ships. The Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) has also been applied by MARPOL to all existing ships. SEEMP provides the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) for monitoring the operational efficiency of a ship. By monitoring the EEOI, the shipowner or operator can establish strategic plans, such as routing, hull cleaning, decommissioning, new building, etc. The key parameter in calculating EEOI is Fuel Oil Consumption (FOC). It can be measured on board while a ship is operating. This means that only the shipowner or operator can calculate the EEOI of their own ships. If the EEOI can be calculated without the actual FOC, however, then the other stakeholders, such as the shipbuilding company and Class, or others who don't have the measured FOC, can check how efficiently their ships are operating compared to other ships. In this study, we propose a method to estimate the EEOI without requiring the actual FOC. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, ship static data, and environment data that can be publicly obtained are used to calculate the EEOI. Since the public data are of large capacity, big data technologies, specifically Hadoop and Spark, are used. We verify the proposed method using actual data, and the result shows that the proposed method can estimate EEOI from public data without actual FOC.},

 abstract = {This chapter introduces the main notions and terminology related to the main dimensions of the ship and the description of the hull surface. The external surface of a ship hull built of steel or aluminium alloy is usually not smooth because the thickness of the shell plating is not uniform. Moreover, in the initial design stage the thickness is not known. Therefore, the main dimensions are defined on the inner surface of the plating and are characterized as moulded dimensions. The principal dimensions are the length between perpendiculars, the moulded breadth known also as beam, the draught and the depth. The classic way of defining the hull surface is by plane sections. The transverse sections are called stations, the horizontal ones waterlines, and the longitudinal buttocks. To classify the various ship forms and relate them to other properties naval architects use non-dimensional numbers known as coefficients of form.},

Fundamentals of Ship Hydrodynamics: Fluid Mechanics, Ship Resistance and Propulsion Lothar Birk, University of New Orleans, USA Bridging the information gap between fluid mechanics and ship hydrodynamics Fundamentals of Ship Hydrodynamics is designed as a textbook for undergraduate education in ship resistance and propulsion. The book provides connections between basic training in calculus and fluid mechanics and the application of hydrodynamics in daily ship design practice. Based on a foundation in fluid mechanics, the origin, use, and limitations of experimental and computational procedures for resistance and propulsion estimates are explained. The book is subdivided into sixty chapters, providing background material for individual lectures. The unabridged treatment of equations and the extensive use of figures and examples enable students to study details at their own pace. Key features: - Covers the range from basic fluid mechanics to applied ship hydrodynamics. - Subdivided into 60 succinct chapters. - In-depth coverage of material enables self-study. - Around 250 figures and tables. Fundamentals of Ship Hydrodynamics is essential reading for students and staff of naval architecture, ocean engineering, and applied physics. The book is also useful for practicing naval architects and engineers who wish to brush up on the basics, prepare for a licensing exam, or expand their knowledge},

@article{Coraddu.2017,
 abstract = {In this paper the authors investigate the problems of predicting the fuel consumption and of providing the best value for the trim of a vessel in real operations based on data measured by the onboard automation systems. Three different approaches for the prediction of the fuel consumption are compared: White, Black and Gray Box Models. White Box Models (WBM) are based on the knowledge of the physical underling processes. Black Box Models (BBMs) build upon statistical inference procedures based on the historical data collection. Finally, the authors propose two different Gray Box Model (GBM) which are able to exploit both mechanistic knowledge of the underlying physical principles and available measurements. Based on these predictive models of the fuel consumption a new strategy for the optimisation of the trim of a vessel is proposed. Results on real world operational data show that the BBM is able to remarkably improve a state-of-the-art WBM, while the GBM is able to encapsulate the a-priory knowledge of the WBM into the BBM so to achieve the same performance of the latter but requiring less historical data. Moreover, results show that the GBM can be used as an effective tool for optimising the trim of a vessel in real operational conditions.},

In the model, the formulas that estimate a ship's added resistance due to waves attacking from different heading angles have been further developed. A correction factor is proposed to consider the nonlinear effect due to large waves in power estimation. The formulas are developed and verified by model tests of 5 ships in regular waves with various heading angles. The full-scale measurements from three different types of ships, i.e., a PCTC, a container ship, and a chemical tanker, are used to validate the proposed model for speed loss prediction in irregular waves. The effect of the improved model for{\&}nbsp;speed loss prediction{\&}nbsp;on a ship's voyage optimization is also investigated. The results indicate that a ship's voyage optimization solutions can be significantly affected by the prediction accuracy of speed loss caused by waves.},

A large ship may be burning up to 100 000 USD of bunker fuel per day, which may constitute more than 75{\%} of its operating costs. Reducing the cruising speed by 20{\%} reduces daily bunker consumption by 50{\%}. However, in order to maintain liner service frequency and capacity, reducing the cruising speed may require additional ships to operate a route. We construct a cost model that we use to analyse the trade-off between speed reduction and adding vessels to a container line route, and devise a simple procedure to identify the sailing speed and number of vessels that minimize the annual operating cost of the route. Using published data, we demonstrate the potential for large-cost savings when one operates close to the minimal-cost speed. The presented methodology and procedure are applicable for any bunker fuel price.},

A generic ship energy systems model is used for the fuel consumption prediction of two reference ships: a RoRo ship and a tanker. The study presents how uncertainties can be categorised and handled in four different phases of a ship's life ? from early design to ship operation. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out for two environmental conditions to calculate the mean and uncertainty of the fuel consumption. The results show that the uncertainty in the fuel consumption prediction in a very early phase of the design process is approximately 12{\%}, whereas at a very late phase, it reduces to less than 4{\%}. Finally, the simulation model is applied to a real ship during operation conditions.},

@article{Wang.2018,
 abstract = {During the voyage, predicting fuel consumption of ships under different sea-states and weather conditions has been a challenging and far-reaching topic, because there are a great number of feature variables affecting the fuel consumption, including main-engine status, cargo weight, ship draft, sea-states and weather conditions, etc. Data driven statistical models have been employed to model the relationship between fuel consumption rate and these voyage parameters. However, some of the feature variables are highly correlated, e.g. wind speed and wave height, air pressure and wind force, cargo weight and draft etc., thus a typical multiple collinearity problem arises so that the fuel consumption cannot be accurately calculated by using the traditional multiple linear regression. In this study, the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression algorithm is employed to implement the variable selection for these feature variables, additionally, it guides the trained predictor towards a generalizable solution, thereby improving the interpretability and accuracy of the model. On the basis of the LASSO, a novel ship fuel consumption prediction model is proposed. Experimentally, the superiority of the proposed method was confirmed by comparing it with some existing methods on predicting the fuel consumption. The proposed method is a promising development that improves the calculation of the fuel consumption.},

The two books together offered a comprehensive insight and overview into the dynamics of global shipping and maritime innovation. Although the core of the books held its value, it was decided to make an update of the two books and merge them into one new textbook, Shipping Innovation, destined for a broad specter of maritime students and professionals. Some substantial new parts were added, as well as some new contributions by other writers. This textbook offers a one-stop-shopping experience to those students and professionals who wish to get acquainted with the multifaceted aspects of global shipping and its everlasting innovation dynamics. Some of the new contributions are the mission-based design process of a Panamax containership and a ro-ro vessel; sustainable shipping and innovation; and an innovation case-study on the revolutionary design of a ballast-free ship.},

 abstract = {This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid, and shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper- parameter optimization algorithms. Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent {\textquotedbl}High Throughput{\textquotedbl} methods achieve surprising success--they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

 abstract = {Decision trees are attractive classifiers due to their high execution speed. But trees derived with traditional methods often cannot be grown to arbitrary complexity for possible loss of generalization accuracy on unseen data. The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved. The validity of the method is demonstrated through experiments on the recognition of handwritten digits.},

 abstract = {A methodology, named ECAIS, is presented to calculate ship emissions based on their fuel consumption from AIS data. This is done to avoid use of commercial ship databases, which can be expensive for research on sizable fleets. Using the approximation method Holtrop-Mennen it is possible to find a distinct ships propulsion power requirements for different speeds. This empirical method uses main ship characteristics for calculation. From AIS data several main ship characteristics can be derived. Remaining characteristics is found by generic ship approximation found in literature surveys. This is used in combination with power prediction and specific fuel consumption, and applied to different ship size categories, as fuel consumption is calculated from speeds in dynamic AIS data. Fuel consumption and CO2 emission are derived and compared to earlier studies.},

Thus, big data analysis for smart ships is an important technology that can be widely applied to improve ship maintenance, operational efficiency, and equipment life management. In this study, an accurate regression model for the fuel consumption of the main engine by using an artificial neural network (ANN) was proposed by big data analysis including data collection, clustering, compression, and expansion. To obtain an accurate regression model, various numbers of hidden layers and neurons and different types of activation functions were tested in the ANN, and their effects on the accuracy and efficiency of the regression analysis were studied. The proposed regression model using ANN is a more accurate and efficient model to predict the fuel consumption of the main engine than polynomial regression and support vector machine.},

Since the problem involves high-dimensional data, this paper develops tree-based modelling on bagging, random forest and bootstrap approach to analyse the ship performance under operational condition. To demonstrate the proposed model, the publicly accessible dataset for 254 trips derived from a particular designed acquisition system on-board ferry ship is utilised. In operational variable analysis on speed through water and fuel consumption, the bootstrap approach yields more accurate prediction rate than random forest and bagging. The proposed model is superior to the others such as ANN and GP applications in ship performance monitoring. Consequently, the tree based model adopting bagging, random forest, and boosting environment is capable of increasing the predictive performance during monitoring of ship performance in maritime industry. Beside its theoretical insight, the findings of the paper contribute ship management companies to monitor ship operational performance.},

For the locally fully developed sea, the spectral peak period Tpf is a function of the significant wave height, Hs, Tpf=af*Hs 1/3 with af slightly dependent on fetch. This classifies sea states as wind sea Tp Tpf each consisting of two wave systems. Empirical parameters given by significant wave height and spectral peak period define the spectral form parameters and energy distribution between the two wave systems in the model. The adequacy of the model is indicated by comparing the model with measured wave spectra from the Norwegian Continental shelf.},

 abstract = {Dynamic speed choice in real-life seaway and market conditions, when subject to technical and contractual constraints, is a highly complex problem. In this paper, we investigate dynamic speed choice using a large dataset of average sailing speeds for nearly 18,000 individual voyages as calculated from Automated Identification System (AIS) data. Using a set of multiple regression models, we expand the traditional analysis of speed determinants, from only macroeconomic variables to also include proxies for organizational constraints, operator quality, trading pattern, loading conditions, technical constraints and ship-specific variables. We find that owners do not appear to adjust vessel speeds based on freight market conditions and fuel prices, as argued in classical maritime economic theory. Instead, vessel-specific variables such as age and design speed, as well as operational factors such as loading conditions, show some explanatory power. The poor model fit may be due to factors outside our model, such as weather conditions and contractual limitations. From a policy point of view, the results actually suggest that higher fuel prices do not contribute to a reduction in vessel speeds and emissions.},

@article{Winther.2014,
 abstract = {This paper presents a detailed BC, NOx and SO2 emission inventory for ships in the Arctic in 2012 based on satellite AIS data, ship engine power functions and technology stratified emission factors. Emission projections are presented for the years 2020, 2030 and 2050. Furthermore, the BC, SO2 and O3 concentrations and the deposition of BC are calculated for 2012 and for two arctic shipping scenarios -- with or without arctic diversion routes due to a possible polar sea ice extent in the future.

In 2012, the largest shares of Arctic ships emissions are calculated for fishing ships (45{\%} for BC, 38{\%} for NOx, 23{\%} for SO2) followed by passenger ships (20{\%}, 17{\%}, 25{\%}), tankers (9{\%}, 13{\%}, 15{\%}), general cargo (8{\%}, 11{\%}, 12{\%}) and container ships (5{\%}, 7{\%}, 8{\%}). In 2050, without arctic diversion routes, the total emissions of BC, NOx and SO2 are expected to change by~+16{\%},~$-$32{\%} and~$-$63{\%}, respectively, compared to 2012. The results for fishing ships are the least certain, caused by a less precise engine power -- sailing speed relation.

The calculated BC, SO2, and O3 surface concentrations and BC deposition contributions from ships are low as a mean for the whole Arctic in 2012, but locally BC additional contributions reach up to 20{\%} around Iceland, and high additional contributions (100--300{\%}) are calculated in some sea areas for SO2. In 2050, the arctic diversion routes highly influence the calculated surface concentrations and the deposition of BC in the Arctic. During summertime navigation contributions become very visible for BC ({\textgreater}80{\%}) and SO2 ({\textgreater}1000{\%}) along the arctic diversion routes, while the O3 ({\textgreater}10{\%}) and BC deposition ({\textgreater}5{\%}) additional contributions, respectively, get highest over the ocean east of Greenland and in the High Arctic.

The geospatial ship type specific emission results presented in this paper have increased the accuracy of the emission inventories for ships in the Arctic. The methodology can be used to estimate shipping emissions in other regions of the world, and hence may serve as an input for other researchers and policy makers working in this field.},

Breiman has pointed out that they rely for their effectiveness on the instability of the base learning algorithm. An alternative approach to generating an ensemble is to randomize the internal decisions made by the base algorithm. This general approach has been studied previously by Ali and Pazzani and by Dietterich and Kong. This paper compares the effectiveness of randomization, bagging, and boosting for improving the performance of the decision-tree algorithm C4.5. The experiments show that in situations with little or no classification noise, randomization is competitive with (and perhaps slightly superior to) bagging but not as accurate as boosting. In situations with substantial classification noise, bagging is much better than boosting, and sometimes better than randomization.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is probably the most widely used goodness-of-fit measure. However, it does not meet the validity criterion due to the fact that the distribution of the absolute percentage errors is usually skewed to the right, with the presence of outlier values. In these cases, MAPE overstates the corresponding population parameter. In this study, we propose an alternative index, called Resistant MAPE or R-MAPE based on the calculation of the Huber M-estimator, which allows overcoming the aforementioned limitation.

METHOD

The results derived from the application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models are used to forecast a time series.

RESULTS

The arithmetic mean, MAPE, overstates the corresponding population parameter, unlike R-MAPE, on a set of error distributions with a statistically significant right skew, as well as outlier values.

CONCLUSIONS

Our results suggest that R-MAPE represents a suitable alternative measure of forecast accuracy, due to the fact that it provides a valid assessment of forecast accuracy compared to MAPE.},

@article{Danaf.2023,
 abstract = {Applications of discrete choice models in personalization are becoming increasingly popular among researchers and practitioners. However, in such systems, when users are presented with successive menus (or choice situations), the alternatives and attributes in each menu depend on the choices made by the user in the previous menus. This gives rise to endogeneity which can result in inconsistent estimates. Our companion paper, Danaf et al. (2020), showed that the estimates are only consistent when the entire choice history of each user is included in estimation. However, this might not be feasible because of computational constraints or data availability. In this paper, we present a control-function (CF) correction for the cases where the choice history cannot be included in estimation. Our method uses the attributes of non-personalized attributes as instruments, and applies the CF correction by including interactions between the explanatory variables and the first stage residuals. Estimation can be done either sequentially or simultaneously, however, the latter is more efficient (if the model reflects the true data generating process). This method is able to recover the population means of the distributed coefficients, especially with a long choice history. The variances are underestimated, because part of the inter-consumer variability is explained by the residuals, which are included in the systematic utility. However, the population variances can be computed from the estimation results. The modified utility equations (which include the residuals) can be used in forecasting and model application, and provide superior fit and predictions.},

@article{Schyen.2015,
 abstract = {This study develops a detailed operational activity-based method to estimate energy efficiency for feeders vessels, both during sailing condition and whilst in port working containers. Two case studies from the North Sea provide empirical evidence on feeder operations and energy efficiency and are compared to estimates presented by International Maritime Organization. The results show that if aggregated methods for energy efficiency estimation are used, appropriate vessel sailing speed, port time/sailing time ratio and cargo capacity utilization need to be taken into account. Information sharing between ocean carriers, feeder operators, port agents and terminals is usually not adequate to allow operational speed optimization per leg. Further, port and terminal price tariffs justifying 24/7 loading/discharging seem to be necessary to stimulate shorter feeder turnaround time and allow for slow steaming and fuel savings. In addition, alignment of incentives for fuel savings among the vessel officers and other parties in the supply chain is critical.},

 abstract = {Short sea shipping (SSS) is the maritime transport of goods over relatively short distances, as opposed to the intercontinental cross-ocean deep sea shipping. The goal of the current paper is to identify SSS growth potential and the univariate regression analysis indicates that the following variables influence total SSS volume in European countries: land area, coastline, total number of SSS ports, number of small SSS ports, number of large SSS ports, number of inhabitants, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), GDP per head, road length and rail length. An additional multivariate regression analysis indicates that more than 78{\%} of the variance in the total SSS volume per country can be explained by variations in the number of large SSS ports and the GDP per head. Finally, future prospects for SSS indicate that most countries show (theoretical) potential to further increase their SSS volume calling for tailor-made policies to utilize this potential.},
