 abstract = {The shipping industry is associated with approximately three quarters of all world trade. In recent years, the sustainability of shipping has become a public concern, and various emissions control regulations to reduce pollutants and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships have been proposed and implemented globally. These regulations aim to drive the shipping industry in a low-carbon and low-pollutant direction by motivating it to switch to more efficient fuel types and reduce energy consumption. At the same time, the cyclical downturn of the world economy and high bunker prices make it necessary and urgent for the shipping industry to operate in a more cost-effective way while still satisfying global trade demand. As bunker fuel bunker (e.g., heavy fuel oil [HFO], liquified natural gas [LNG]) consumption is the main source of emissions and bunker fuel costs account for a large proportion of operating costs, shipping companies are making unprecedented efforts to optimize ship energy efficiency. It is widely accepted that the key to improving the energy efficiency of ships is the development of accurate models to predict ship fuel consumption rates under different scenarios. In this study, ship fuel consumption prediction models presented in the literature (including the academic literature and technical reports as a typical type of ``grey literature'') are reviewed and compared, and models that optimize ship operations based on fuel consumption prediction results are also presented and discussed. Current research challenges and promising research questions on ship performance monitoring and operational optimization are identified.},

@article{Kim.2020b,
 abstract = {To prevent pollution from ships, the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) is a mandatory guideline for all new ships. The Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) has also been applied by MARPOL to all existing ships. SEEMP provides the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) for monitoring the operational efficiency of a ship. By monitoring the EEOI, the shipowner or operator can establish strategic plans, such as routing, hull cleaning, decommissioning, new building, etc. The key parameter in calculating EEOI is Fuel Oil Consumption (FOC). It can be measured on board while a ship is operating. This means that only the shipowner or operator can calculate the EEOI of their own ships. If the EEOI can be calculated without the actual FOC, however, then the other stakeholders, such as the shipbuilding company and Class, or others who don't have the measured FOC, can check how efficiently their ships are operating compared to other ships. In this study, we propose a method to estimate the EEOI without requiring the actual FOC. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, ship static data, and environment data that can be publicly obtained are used to calculate the EEOI. Since the public data are of large capacity, big data technologies, specifically Hadoop and Spark, are used. We verify the proposed method using actual data, and the result shows that the proposed method can estimate EEOI from public data without actual FOC.},
